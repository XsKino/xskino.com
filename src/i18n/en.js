                  <strong>My name is Kino</strong>, I'm from Mexico ðŸŒ® and I like coding, art, and videogames.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a child I had a lot of dreams, some of which I still want to accomplish, from having a big Youtube channel, to being a music producer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When I was 12 I got really into game development, to the point that my dream was to become an indie game developer back then, although I couldn't do much, since I didn't have a decent PC,
                  but thanks to that dream, I discovered that <strong>I really enjoy programming!</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  And even though I didn't take the game development route, I still have a great love for videogames, and I would love to be able to fulfill that dream someday.
                </p>`

                <p>
                  Among my <strong>biggest achievements</strong>, is having <strong>lead development teams</strong> in multiple hackathons and contests, Some of which my team and I won.

                  I discovered my love for programming through game development, so I genuinely believe that,
                  just like videogames, <strong>engineering and software development are an expression of art</strong>,
                  and as such, it requires <strong>love</strong> and <strong>perseverance</strong>.
